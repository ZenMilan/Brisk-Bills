activities_with_prices:
  * Move_to_invoice function should allow us to Move_to '(Unassigned)', and ideally that would be a radio group

* We may want to go through the controllers and modify the searches a bit:
  config.columns[:clients].search_sql
  config.search.columns = config.list.columns 

- Release gem as 'final'

--- Put a beta version on mario? ... 

* Use polymorphic relationship for sub activities
  * I really don't like the way we're uing dont_validate_type_associations. ..
  * See if we can get rid of the association_hacks while we're at it ...

* Translate the time into the local zone for the user, probably each user/client should have a zone associtation in their account.
  *  Its already stored in UTC everywhere...
  * We need to factor this into invoices too, I think

* Rails 3.x?

* Plugin interface...
  * We should DRY the interfaces for inheritance on the activities and invoices controllers (See  "TODO: Put in a plugin-helper?")
  * I think the mountable apps is our good solution. Alongside a generator
 
* Ideally we have that DraftInvoices/ "Batch Create" link to the left of Create..

* Assign version numbers to the invoice based on the number of times an invoice is published...
  * I don't know if we should/need-to adjust the invoice pdfs out here just yet ....

* Slimtimer-less time entry
  * http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/index.shtml

* reocurring payments module with rake task
	* DDC / GI / Ashbritt / Manny Kadre bills

* Start using 0.9 on mario...

* Publish !!!!!
---------------
* Things might be a little awkward with out activity assignment if people are going back and editing old stuff... we should really have an activity selector...

* all delete confirms should go through the modal box

* Probably - when prompted to delete an invoice, we should give the option to also remove the activities (or preserve them and leave them unsassigned)

* Public interface

* Publish 1.0 !!!!!
---------------

* Eventlogs as an unedutable nested list  might be nice... Hell, employee eventlogs too....
  
* CC payments handling built-in- not a plugin

* Revise the site-settings interfaces...

* Publish 1.1 !!!!!
---------------

LONGER-TERM Features: (Needs re-prioritization...)

* We should audit for proper transaction support, and test!

* All of our read_attribute stuff, isn't "Caching"the newest values. (I think - write a test for this ...)
	* Use a find_invoice_with_totals
		* then update an invoice
		* then run an invoice.amunt(true)
		* tune run an invice.amount .... This this treturn the prior amount value?
	* THis has to be fixed/ested for all read attributes...

* Drop the VIEW hacks and de-normalize the payments/invoices tables. Just 'cache' the irksome values in here

Feature: Make the Search actually work the way we'd expect. Perhaps even make something mroe useful still that would let us filter records...

BUG: We should probably write a plugin that better displays delete errors in the flash[:error] , invoices is a good place for that

* The ability to create an activity from the activities & invoices/activities list would be sweet
	* With a little pop-up that asks for the activity type?

* Emailer: 
	* <p>Please note that your current account balance, including this invoice, is: $XXX.XXX . Invoices 1,2, & 3 are outstanding. <red>Invoices 1 & 2 are past their 30 day </red> </p>
	* And change the if line to only send when there's been a change in the invoice status (See the invoice TODO...)
	* This gets a little complicated though - we have to decide if we're going to generate these warnings based on the date of the invoice, or the current situation
	
* The invoice issued_on date I think is rounding off to the end of the day on assignment. It should really be time sensitive.

Plugins for 
   * Reimbursable scanning
	* phone calls
		* The :phone_extension field, *might* be something we put into the asterisk plugin 

* An employee_rate_changed_last changed plugin would be super-useful at some point...
