* 2.3.8 upgrade ?
  * Remove the rhtml's and rjs's and use js.rjs and html.erb
  * Go through the plugins - enable everything, and remove the plugs line
  * Test the activity assignments on invoice create
    * Test activity move
  * Test the nested activities on the invoices controller

* Ok - you left off finishing up the activities controller

-=-=  
* Double check that we're removing payment assignments on invoice unpublish..

* Assign version numbers to the invoice based on the number of times an invoice is published...
  * I don't know if we should/need-to adjust the invoice pdfs out here just yet ....
  * Might as well put this in migration 29 while we're publishing anyways

* Invoices
  * Make the is_published a row_link
    * Use JS to (YES/NO) ask them to confirm if they want to send an invoice by mail - cancel cancels the action
    * Use JS to confirm an unpublish
  * Only allow edits on an unpublished invoice - use the is_authorized to accomplish this

* Move_to_invoice function should allow us to Move_to '(Unassigned)', and ideally that would be a radio group

* Payment:::is_allocated should probably be added to a view and then list controller...
  * Code is there - but no view supports it...

* We should add an unpublished Open Invoices controller ...

* Is there a bug saving invoice comments on unpublished invoices? ... (maybe its just when you're choosing no?)

* I'd like to see a payment identifier listed in the payments list ... (check no/cc#)

* We should put tax before cost in the activities with prices controller...

* WHen Assigning employees to labr_rates - the form stays open between updates and shouldnt...



--- Put a beta version on mario? ... Do this then:
    # NOTE: One way to 'fix' any problems with your invoice assignments is to: 
    #   InvoicePayment.find(:all).each{|ip| ip.destroy}
    #   Payment.find(:all).each{|pmt| if pmt.amount > Money.new(0) then pmt.invoice_assignments = pmt.client.recommend_invoice_assignments_for(pmt.amount); pmt.save! end }

* Translate the time into the local zone for the user, probably each user/client should have a zone associtation in their account.
  *  Its already stored in UTC everywhere...
  * We need to factor this into invoices too, I think
  
--- 
* Slimtimer-less time entry
  * http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/index.shtml

* Use polymorphic relationship for sub activities
  * I really don't like the way we're uing dont_validate_type_associations. ..

* reocurring payments module with rake task
	* DDC / GI / Ashbritt / Manny Kadre bills

* Things might be a little awkward with out activity assignment if people are going back and editing old stuff... we should really have an activity selector...

* Start using 0.8-pre on mario...

* Publish !!!!!
---------------
* all delete confirms should go through the modal box

* Probably - when prompted to delete an invoice, we should give the option to also remove the activities (or preserve them and leave them unsassigned)

* Public interface

* Showing the Client eventlogs as an unedutable nested list  might be nice... Hell, employee eventlogs too....

* Publish !!!!!
---------------
  
* CC payments handling built-in- not a plugin

* Revise the site-settings interfaces...

* Plugin interface...

* Publish 0.9 !!!!!
---------------
---------------
LONGER-TERM Features: (Needs re-prioritization...)

* We should audit for proper transaction support, and test!

* All of our read_attribute stuff, isn't "Caching"the newest values. (I think - write a test for this ...)
	* Use a find_invoice_with_totals
		* then update an invoice
		* then run an invoice.amunt(true)
		* tune run an invice.amount .... This this treturn the prior amount value?
	* THis has to be fixed/ested for all read attributes...

* Drop the VIEW hacks and de-normalize the payments/invoices tables. Just 'cache' the irksome values in here

Feature: Make the Search actually work the way we'd expect. Perhaps even make something mroe useful still that would let us filter records...

BUG: We should probably write a plugin that better displays delete errors in the flash[:error] , invoices is a good place for that

* The ability to create an activity from the activities & invoices/activities list would be sweet
	* With a little pop-up that asks for the activity type?

* Emailer: 
	* <p>Please note that your current account balance, including this invoice, is: $XXX.XXX . Invoices 1,2, & 3 are outstanding. <red>Invoices 1 & 2 are past their 30 day </red> </p>
	* And change the if line to only send when there's been a change in the invoice status (See the invoice TODO...)
	* This gets a little complicated though - we have to decide if we're going to generate these warnings based on the date of the invoice, or the current situation
	
* The invoice issued_on date I think is rounding off to the end of the day on assignment. It should really be time sensitive.
	
* Better unit tests for Activity::* model. (too , make sure negative values work on whatever..)


Plugins for 
   * Reimbursable scanning
	* phone calls
		* The :phone_extension field, *might* be something we put into the asterisk plugin 

* An employee_rate_changed_last changed plugin would be super-useful at some point...
